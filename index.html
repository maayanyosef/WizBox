            What is an IP address and why is it important?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique number assigned to devices connected to the internet. It allows devices to communicate and exchange data across the web, making it essential for browsing, streaming, and accessing online services.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            How do I find my public IP address?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can find your public IP address using tools like "What Is My IP." These tools display the current IP address assigned to your internet connection by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>IPv4 addresses are the most commonly used format and consist of four sets of numbers. IPv6 is the newer version designed to provide more IP addresses as the internet grows, using a longer, hexadecimal format.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            What is my public vs private IP address?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>A public IP address is the one assigned to your network by your ISP and is used to access the internet. A private IP address is used within your local network and is not visible to the outside world.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            How can I hide or change my IP address?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can hide or change your IP address using a VPN (Virtual Private Network), which masks your real IP and provides a different one from another location, enhancing your online privacy and security.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            How does my IP address reveal my location?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Your IP address is linked to your ISP, which assigns a range of IP addresses to geographic regions. This allows websites and services to approximate your location based on the IP address.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            Can my IP address be used to track me online?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>While your IP address reveals your general location, it doesn’t provide detailed personal information. However, it can be used by websites and law enforcement agencies to track online activity, which is why using a VPN is recommended for privacy.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            Why does my IP address keep changing?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>If you have a dynamic IP address, your ISP can assign a new one periodically. This is common for residential internet connections. If you want a permanent IP, you can request a static IP from your ISP, though it may come with additional costs.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            What are the risks of exposing my public IP address?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>While knowing your public IP address is generally not harmful, sharing it publicly can expose you to risks like DDoS attacks or unwanted surveillance. Using security tools like firewalls and VPNs can mitigate these risks.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            How can I check if my IP address is blacklisted?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can use a DNSBL (DNS-based Blackhole List) Lookup tool to check if your IP address is blacklisted. Being blacklisted means your IP is flagged for suspicious activity, often due to spam or hacking attempts.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location. This helps improve the speed, reliability, and performance of websites by caching content close to the user.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A CDN works by distributing content across multiple servers in different geographic locations. When a user requests content, the CDN delivers it from the nearest server, reducing latency and improving load times.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A CDN can improve website security by providing features such as DDoS protection, SSL/TLS encryption, and Web Application Firewalls (WAF). These features help safeguard your website against various cyberattacks and ensure secure data transmission.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>While a CDN is not necessary for all websites, it is highly recommended for sites with a global audience or heavy traffic. Websites with large files (like videos and images) or those that need to maintain high performance under load can greatly benefit from using a CDN.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A CDN can improve website performance for users in both local and global markets. It reduces latency by caching content on servers closer to the users' location, which speeds up load times and enhances the browsing experience for local visitors as well.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, using a CDN can reduce bandwidth costs. By caching content closer to users and offloading traffic from your origin server, a CDN reduces the amount of data that your server has to deliver, potentially lowering hosting and bandwidth expenses.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>When you run a ping command, it sends small data packets (ICMP Echo Requests) to a specified IP address or domain. If the target is reachable, it responds with an ICMP Echo Reply. The ping utility then measures the time it took to get the response, indicating how fast the connection is.</p>

        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            What are security headers?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Security headers are HTTP response headers that enhance the security of a website by controlling how browsers behave when interacting with your site. They help protect against various attacks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), clickjacking, and code injection.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            Why are security headers important?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Security headers are important because they add an extra layer of protection to your website by enforcing security policies. They help mitigate vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting, code injection, and protocol downgrade attacks, ensuring that your users' data is more secure.</p>

        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            What are the most important security headers I should implement?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Some of the most important security headers include:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)</strong>: Enforces HTTPS and prevents protocol downgrade attacks.</li>
                  <li><strong>Content-Security-Policy (CSP)</strong>: Prevents cross-site scripting and data injection attacks.</li>
                  <li><strong>X-Frame-Options</strong>: Prevents clickjacking attacks by disallowing your website to be loaded in iframes.</li>
                  <li><strong>X-Content-Type-Options</strong>: Prevents MIME-type sniffing and forces browsers to stick to declared content types.</li>
                  <li><strong>Referrer-Policy</strong>: Controls how much referrer information is shared when users navigate between websites.</li>
               </ul>

        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            How do I check if my website has security headers?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can check your website’s security headers by using a Security Headers Check tool like WizBox Security Headers Check. Simply enter your domain, and the tool will analyze your website’s HTTP response headers to determine which security headers are implemented and which are missing.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            What is the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header is designed to protect your website against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and data injection by restricting the sources from which content (such as scripts, styles, or images) can be loaded. It allows you to define which external sources are considered safe.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            How does the HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header work?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header tells browsers that your site should only be accessed via HTTPS. It helps prevent protocol downgrade attacks and ensures secure connections by automatically redirecting all HTTP requests to HTTPS.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            How do I add security headers to my website?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can add security headers by modifying your web server configuration (such as Apache, NGINX, or IIS). Alternatively, you can use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or a web application firewall (WAF) to inject the security headers into your HTTP responses. Specific implementation steps will depend on the platform you are using.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            What is X-Frame-Options and why is it important?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The X-Frame-Options header prevents your website from being embedded in an iframe on other websites. This helps protect against clickjacking attacks, where malicious sites try to trick users into clicking hidden buttons or links that perform unwanted actions on your site.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            What happens if I don’t use security headers?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>If you don’t use security headers, your website may be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and MIME-type sniffing. These attacks can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or malicious code injection that compromises the security of your users and your website.</p>

        <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            Can security headers improve my website’s SEO?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>While security headers don’t directly affect SEO rankings, implementing security headers like HTTPS through HSTS can improve user trust and website security. Google prioritizes secure websites, so having security headers can contribute indirectly to better search engine rankings by ensuring your website is secure and trusted by users.</p>
